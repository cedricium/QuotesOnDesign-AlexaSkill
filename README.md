# Quotes on Design

### now on Amazon Alexa devices

This is my submission for the Amazon June Giveaway of an Echo Dot. Using Node.js, this Alexa Skill is similar to the Android app I created, Quotr. By requesting a new quote or asking to be inspired, Alexa will respond with a quote and its corresponding author. Again, I used the "Quotes on Design" (http://quotesondesign.com/) API.

I do plan on improving this Skill to allow using "slots", basically parameters used when making a request, such as "Akexa, ask Quotes on Design for a quote by {author}".

NOTE: This skill is currently in the certification process and not yet listed on the Alexa Skills store.
